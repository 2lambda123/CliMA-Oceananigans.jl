1. The staggered grid

A 1D schematic of the geometry of the staggerd grid, sometimes referred to as
the Arakawa C-grid, is shown below

face   cell   face   cell   face

        i-1            i
         ↓             ↓
  |      ×      |      ×      |
  ↑             ↑             ↑
 i-1            i            i+1

where `|` denotes a cell interface and `×` denotes a cell center. Each cell is
bounded by two walls or interfaces so that there are `N` cell centers and `N+1`
cell interfaces along each dimension.

Tracers and pressure are stored at the cell centers. Velocities are stored
at the faces.

In 3D it becomes useful to specify the location of a field by a 3-tuple:
	- Tracers:    (Center, Center, Center)
	- u velocity: (Face,   Center, Center)
	- v velocity: (Center, Face,   Center)
	- w velocity: (Center, Center,   Face)

2. Operator naming conventions

Difference operators are denoted by a `δ` (`\delta`). The `ϊ` (`\iota\ddot`) symbol
indicates that an interpolation is being performed.

The three characters at the end of the function name, `faa` for example, indicates
that the output will lie on the cell faces in the x-dimension but will remain at
their original positions in the y- and z-dimensions. Thus we further identify this
operator by `_faa` where the `a` stands for "any" as the location is unchanged by
the operator and is determined by the input.


3. Difference operators

Calculating the difference
of a cell-centered quantity ϕ at cell i will return the difference at face i

    δϕᵢ = ϕᵢ - ϕᵢ₋₁

This operation, if applied along the x-dimension, will be denoted by `δx_faa`.

The difference of a face-centered quantity u at face i will return the difference
at cell i

    δuᵢ = uᵢ₊₁ - uᵢ

This operation is denoted `δx_caa` when applied along the x-dimension.


4. Interpolation operators

The interpolation of a quantity ϕ from a cell i to face i is given by

    ϊx_faa(ϕ)ᵢ = (ϕᵢ + ϕᵢ₋₁) / 2

Conversely, the interpolation of a quantity u from a face i to cell i is given by

    ϊx_caa(u)ᵢ = (uᵢ₊₁ + uᵢ) / 2
