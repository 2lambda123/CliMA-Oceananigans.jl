# Boundary conditions
A boundary condition is applied to each field, dimension, and endpoint. There are left and right (or bottom and top)
boundary conditions for each of the x, y, and z dimensions so each field is associated with 6 boundary conditions. Each
of these boundary conditions may be specified individually. Each boundary condition can be specified via a constant
value, an array, or a function.

See [Numerical implementation of boundary conditions](@ref numerical_bcs) for more details.

!!! warning "Consistent boundary conditions"
    Be careful to ensure that you don't set up a model with inconsistent boundary conditions. For example, periodic
    boundary conditions should remain imposed on all fields and endpoints for periodic dimensions, and velocities
    normal to a wall (e.g. vertical velocity w with walls at the top and bottom) must have no-penetration boundary
    conditions.

## Types of boundary conditions
1. [`Periodic`](@ref Periodic)
2. [`Flux`](@ref Flux)
3. [`Value`](@ref Value) ([`Dirchlet`](@ref))
4. [`Gradient`](@ref Gradient) ([`Neumann`](@ref))
5. [`No-penetration`](@ref NoPenetration)

Notice that open boundary conditions and radiation boundary conditions can be imposed via flux or value boundary
conditions defined by a function or array.

## Default boundary conditions
By default, periodic boundary conditions are applied on all fields along horizontal dimensions.
All horizontal velocities are periodic and free slip at the boundaries.
No normal flow boundary conditions are applied at the top and bottom boundaries.
Tracer boundary conditions are no-flux at the top and bottom and periodic elsewhere.

## Boundary condition structures
Oceananigans uses a hierarchical structure to expressing boundary conditions.
1. A [`BoundaryCondition`](@ref) is associated with every field, dimension, and endpoint.
2. Boundary conditions specifying the condition at the left and right endpoints (or top and bottom endpoints) are
   grouped into [`CoordinateBoundaryConditions`](@ref).
3. A set of three `CoordinateBoundaryConditions` specifying the boundary conditions along the x, y, and z dimensions
   for a single field are grouped into a [`FieldBoundaryConditions`](@ref) named tuple.
4. A set of `FieldBoundaryConditions`, one for each field, are grouped together into a named tuple and passed to the
   `Model` constructor.

Boundary conditions are defined at model construction time by passing a named tuple of `FieldBoundaryConditions`
specifying boundary conditions on every field: velocities ($u$, $v$, $w$) and all tracers.

Typically you only want to impose a few boundary conditions, in which case it's useful to use convenience constructors
such as [`HorizontallyPeriodicBCs`](@ref) when constructing horizontally periodic boundary conditions for a field and
[`HorizontallyPeriodicSolutionBCs`](@ref) when constructing horizontally periodic boundary conditions for a model.
Also see [`ChannelBCs`](@ref) and [`ChannelSolutionBCs`](@ref).

See the sections below for more details. The examples and verification experiments also provide examples for setting up
many difference kinds of boundary conditions.

## Creating individual boundary conditions
Some examples of creating individual boundary conditions:

1. A constant Value (Dirchlet) boundary condition, perhaps representing a constant temperature at some boundary.
```@example
using Oceananigans # hide
constant_T_bc = BoundaryCondition(Value, 20)
```

2. A constant flux boundary condition, perhaps representing a constant wind stress at some boundary such as the ocean
   surface.
```@example
using Oceananigans # hide
ρ₀ = 1027  # Reference density [kg/m³]
τₓ = 0.08  # Wind stress [N/m²]
wind_stress_bc = BoundaryCondition(Flux, τₓ/ρ₀)
```

3. A spatially varying (white noise) cooling flux to be imposed at some boundary. Note that the boundary condition
   is given by the array `Q` here. When running on the GPU, `Q` must be converted to a `CuArray`.
```@example
using Oceananigans # hide
Nx = Ny = 16  # Number of grid points.

ρ₀ = 1027  # Reference density [kg/m³]
cₚ = 4000  # Heat capacity of water at constant pressure [J/kg/K]

Q  = randn(Nx, Ny) ./ (ρ₀ * cₚ)

white_noise_T_bc = BoundaryCondition(Flux, Q)
```

## Specifying boundary conditions with functions
You can also specify the boundary condition via a function. For z boundary conditions the function will be called with
the signature
```
f(i, j, grid, t, U, C, params)
```
where `i, j` is the grid index, `grid` is `model.grid`, `t` is the `model.clock.time`, `U` is the named tuple
`model.velocities`, `C` is the named tuple `C.tracers`, and `params` is the user-defined `model.parameters`. The
signature is similar for x and y boundary conditions expect that `i, j` is replaced with `j, k` and `i, k` respectively.

We can add a fourth example now:
4. A spatially varying and time-dependent heating representing perhaps a localized source of heating modulated by a
   diurnal cycle.
```@example
using Oceananigans # hide
@inline Q(i, j, grid, t, U, C, params) = @inbounds exp(-(grid.xC[i]^2 + grid.yC[j]^2)) * sin(2π*t)
localized_heating_bc = BoundaryCondition(Flux, Q)
```

!!! info "Performance of functions in boundary conditions"
    For performance reasons, you should define all functions used in boundary conditions as inline functions via the
    `@inline` macro. If any arrays are accessed within the function, disabling bounds-checking with `@inbounds` can
    also speed things up.

## Specifying boundary conditions on a field
To, for example, create a set of horizontally periodic field boundary conditions
```@example
using Oceananigans # hide
T_bcs = HorizontallyPeriodicBCs(   top = BoundaryCondition(Value, 20),
                                bottom = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, 0.01))
```
which will create a [`FieldBoundaryConditions`](@ref) object for temperature T appropriate for horizontally periodic
model configurations where the x and y boundary conditions are all periodic.

## Specifying model boundary conditions
A named tuple of [`FieldBoundaryConditions`](@ref) objects must be passed to the Model constructor specifying boundary
conditions on all fields. To, for example, impose non-default boundary conditions on the u-velocity and temperature
```@example
using Oceananigans # hide
u_bcs = HorizontallyPeriodicBCs(   top = BoundaryCondition(Value, 0.1),
                                bottom = BoundaryCondition(Value, -0.1))
T_bcs = HorizontallyPeriodicBCs(   top = BoundaryCondition(Value, 20),
                                bottom = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, 0.01))

model_bcs = HorizontallyPeriodicSolutionBCs(u=u_bcs, T=T_bcs)

model = Model(grid=RegularCartesianGrid(size=(16, 16, 16), length=(1, 1, 1)),
              boundary_conditions=model_bcs)
nothing # hide
```
